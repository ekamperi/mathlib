[NOTE]
Portions of stuff mentioned here are WIP. If this page doesn't render properly, blame asciidoc.

== Objectives ==
The goals of the project are to:

* Write _unit tests_ for the +math.h+, +fenv.h+, +complex.h+ and +float.h+ interfaces.
* Implement support for _floating-point exceptions_ for common architectures (x86/amd64) and for less common (sparc64, m68k).
* Implement _long double_ versions of math functions (software emulated for a start, i.e. not FPU optimized).
* Write tools that will allow _observability_ of the mathlib, such as measuring the error in floating-point computations or the speed of the algorithms.
* Audit existing code, fix or document where due.

== How to get you started ==
=== ATF tests ===
In order to _checkout_ the tests you need http://git-scm.com[Git]:

     git clone git://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git

Subsequent _updates_ are done with:

     % cd mathlib
     mathlib% git pull

There's also a http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git[Gitweb interface] for checking the code with your browser. From the same place you can download _tar archives_ of the entire source tree, if for some reason you can't/don't want to afford git.

In order to run the tests you need http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf[Automated Testing Framework]. NetBSD ships it by default.
If you don't run NetBSD and you have installed ATF by yourself with some non-default prefix, e.g. +/usr/local+, make sure that your +PATH+ environmental variable is set properly.

You also need +gmake+. I'm not happy with it, but it was the only viable option to write portable Makefiles.

   % cd mathlib
   mathlib% gmake -k
   mathlib% gmake run
   % cd fenv
   mathlib/fenv% gmake -k
   mathlib/fevn% gmake run

=== mathlib unified diffs ===
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/netbsd/[Here] you can find (more or less) up to date diffs against NetBSD HEAD. These patches are about fenv.h interface support, long double versions, namespace issues or just comments to existing code.

You can apply the diffs with:

      % patch -p0 < mathlib.diff

And then refer to http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-updating.html[NetBSD guide] on how to build source and install new world. Or just follow these steps:

    % su root -c 'mkdir /usr/obj; chmod g+w /usr/obj'
    % cd /usr/src
    % ./build.sh -O /usr/obj -T /usr/tools -U distribution sets
    % su root -c 'cd /usr/src && ./build.sh -O /usr/obj -U install=/'

=== Error estimation of libm functions ===
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git/tree/master:/ulps[Here] you can find a utility to calculate the error in terms of +ULPs+ for most of the libm functions. It depends on the existence of +gmp+ and +mpfr+; an arbitrary precision arithmetic library and a multi-precision floating-point library, respectively.

In order to build it, please do the following:

    mathlib% cd ulps 
    mathlib/ulps% autoreconf && ./configure && make

Only +autoconf+ is needed (2.59 or later). +Automake+ is _not_ needed.

If none argument is given, all supported functions are probed, e.g.

    mathlib/ulps% ./ulps            
    [ 1/31] function: acos     max ulp: 0.0000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0000  [skipped =     0]
    [ 2/31] function: acosh    max ulp: 0.5000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0001  [skipped =     0]
    [ 3/31] function: asin     max ulp: 0.5000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0000  [skipped =     0]
    [ 4/31] function: asinh    max ulp: 0.5000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0001  [skipped =     0]
    [ 5/31] function: atan     max ulp: 0.5000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0000  [skipped =     0]
    Percentage complete: 83.60
    ^C

Otherwise, individual function names may be provided, e.g.

    mathlib/ulps% ./ulps cbrt fabs
    [ 1/ 2] function: cbrt     max ulp: 0.5000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0923  [skipped =     0]
    [ 2/ 2] function: fabs     max ulp: 0.0000  min ulp: 0.0000  avg ulp: 0.0000  [skipped =     0]

The definition of +ULP+ that we are using may be found http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2242/libm-3lib?a=view[in this document]. Although reasonable voices have been raised regarding the fitness of this definition, its straight-forwardness from an implementation point of view and the fact that it allows us direct comparisons with good libm's, like Solaris, made us stick to it for the moment.

If you have some exotic hardware, please do me a favor. Run the diagnostics and mail me back the results. I have uploaded mine here. More to come.

NOTE: Incidentally, we discovered a bug in +mpfr+. If +mpfr_tgamma()+ was called with an argument that would naturally cause an underflow, it would enter an infinite loop. Upstream developers were informed and problem was solved both in +svn trunk+ and in +3.0+ branch. See also
http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.0.0/#fixed[this].

=== Performance measure ===
We have performance probes for http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git/tree/master:/etc[+fenv.h+] interface, e.g.

    mathlib/etc% ./proffenv
    feclearexcept() FE_ALL_EXCEPT:   256 msecs for 1000000 iterations
    feclearexcept()        random:   289 msecs for 1000000 iterations
         fegetenv()              :   233 msecs for 1000000 iterations
    feraiseexcept()              :   457 msecs for 1000000 iterations
         fesetenv()    FE_DFL_ENV:   241 msecs for 1000000 iterations
         fesetenv()        random:   483 msecs for 1000000 iterations
      feupdateenv()    FE_DFL_ENV:   291 msecs for 1000000 iterations
      feupdateenv()        random:   533 msecs for 1000000 iterations
    mathlib/etc% 

Since recently, we are able to measure the performance of +math.h+ functions, *with respect to their input*. Code is http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git/blob/master:/etc/profmath.c[here]. Graphs are http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/graphs[here]. You can generate your own, if you have +gnuplot+ installed, via:

    % cd mathlib/etc
    mathlib/etc% make gen-graphs
    [...]

Most algorithms exhibit constant-time behaviour, but there are some interesting cases, e.g., compare
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/graphs/NetBSD/5.99.33/i386/cos.csv.png[NetBSD cos()] against,
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/graphs/SunOS/5.11/i86pc/cos.csv.png[OpenSolaris cos()].
(Our graph maybe interpreted on the basis of +iterative argument reduction+ for very large inputs. It seems that Sun's developers managed to short circuit it.)

This tool will allow us to identify pathological cases in existing implementations and protect us from introducing such when we will implement the long double versions.

=== C code generator ===
For every math function, we test it against a small set of good +{x, ..., f(x, ...)}+ pairs. These data are
generated automatically by a utility, that resides
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git/blob_plain/master:/etc/goodgen.c[here]. It uses the
+gmp/mpfr+ libraries. The output is valid C code that can be used without any modifications.
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/mathlib.git/blob/master:/include/t_acos.h[This is an example].

== Automated tests ==
We are running irregularly irregular http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/logs[automated tests] against:

* NetBSD
** x86, amd64, vax, m68k and sparc64
* FreeBSD
** x86, amd64
* Linux
** x86, amd64
* OpenSolaris
** amd64 

If you have some {OS, platform} combination that is not listed in here, I would be grateful if you did:

    ~% cd mathlib 
    mathlib% make run-html

And mailed me back the +results.html+ file.

=== Error signaling ===
There are two ways for libm to signal errors during computations. Either via errno or by raising floating-point exceptions. POSIX expects that at least one is supported. We should expose our capabilities by defining +math_errhandling+ and +MATH_ERRNO|MATH_ERREXCEPT+.

Errno is readily available. As for floating-point exceptions, currently only +i386+ and +amd64+ support them. Question is whether errno and/or floatint-point evnironment is properly manipulated by libm.

Preliminary results for +i386+
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/logs/NetBSD/5.99.29/i386/results-errno-30-06-10.html[errno]
and
http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~beket/logs/NetBSD/5.99.29/i386/results-errexcept-30-06-10.html[errexcept].

=== Namespace issues ===
* Defining +_POSIX_C_SOURCE+ or +_XOPEN_SOURCE+ prior to the inclusion of +math.h+ hides copysign() function. Possibly others too.
* +signbit()+ uses a gcc builtin function that only works with floats and doubles. Roll out our own just like FreeBSD does.

=== VAX ===
We don't have +nextafter()+ or +nextbefore()+ implementations for VAX, which blocks us from calculating the +ULPs+ of the various math functions.

=== Build issues in tests (almost done) ===
For every function we write test cases for, we check its +float+, +double+ and +long double+ version, in the _same_ test program. On the other hand, NetBSD misses a lot of *l() functions, which blocks test programs from building. Therefore, we need to use +autoconf+ and surround the hot spots with +#ifdef+ blocks. Just like we do in +ulps/+.
